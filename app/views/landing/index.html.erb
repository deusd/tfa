        <strong>YOUR ENTIRE CHURCH RIGHT HERE </strong> <br>
        <p>Your church is so much more than a building. It’s a living breathing organization with so much to showcase.
          With your custom profile on The Fellowship App you can do just that and so much more. </p>

        <strong>WORSHIP ON-DEMAND</strong>
        <p>Worship isn’t just on Sunday or in the confines of the sanctuary. Allow people to stream your live service
          and
          past sermons whenever they like from anywhere in the world.</p>

              to service times and amenities we help people find the church that fits them best.</p>

            <strong>SEE WHAT’S IN YOUR AREA. ANYWHERE</strong>
            <p>Find a place to worship close to where you are, wether you have been there for a few years, just moved to
              a
              new area or are traveling over the weekend. It’s all right in your hand. </p>

        <h2>Save time, save money. Take your giving to the next level.</h2>

        <strong>NO CASH, NO PROBLEM!</strong> <br>
        <p>Passing around an offering plate is great, if all your members carry hundreds in cash or still have a
          leftover check. The digital age requires digital payments that can tracked, managed, and processed instantly.
          Oh yea, from anywhere! </p>

        <strong>TAX SEASON, SHMAX SEASON</strong>
        <p>The bigger your church the harder it is to keep track of individual giving come tax season. Well, The
          Fellowship App makes it as breeze. We keep track of all your donations automatically and send you a simple
          spreadsheet at the end of the year. You’re welcome Finance Ministry. </p>
